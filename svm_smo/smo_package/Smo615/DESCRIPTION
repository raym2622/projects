Description: We implement a support vector classifier using SMO algorithm in C++ and 
    compile it into this R package. It seeks to find a decision boundary with the greatest 
    margin of separation between the input classes. If the training data are not linearly 
    separable, a "soft-margin" (or regularized) version can be implemented that allows for 
    misclassified samples. The output decision boundary can be linear, as it is with 
    logisitic regression, or non-linear with the use of various kernels that map the input         
    features to a higher-dimensional space.
