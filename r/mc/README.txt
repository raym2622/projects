Here we would design a Monte Carlo study to compare the coverage probabilities and width of the following two confidence intervals for the median:

i. the non-parametric bootstrap with 1,000 bootstrap samples;

ii. the robust estimator $\bar\theta \pm z_{\alpha/2} * \bar\sigma / \sqrt{n}$ where $\bar\theta$ is the sample median and $\bar\sigma$ is 1.49 times the median absolute deviation ($mad$).
