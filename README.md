## Welcome to my github!

My name is Rui Ma. Currently I am Master's student at the University of Michigan studying Applied Statistics. Here are some projects that I have done over the years. The java projects were done when I was in undergrad at the University of Washington.

If you have any questions, please shoot me an email at __*raym2622@gmail.com*__. Thanks!
